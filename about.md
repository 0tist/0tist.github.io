## Hey ! How you doing?
 
# Who am I?
 I'm an undergraduate student at Netaji Subhas University of technology(erstwhile Netaji Subhas Institue of technology). I am on a self-learning journey to absorb as much as I can about the Data science, Deep Learning and Software development in general. I spent most of my days reading research papers and trying to implement them, as a result I developed an interest in Research and Development. I'm always interested in taking on new projects and participating on online contests and events. Lately, I've gained in the study of brain - Neuroscience and its engineering - Neuroengineering. I was an active member of IEEE Delhi Section and Computer Science Chapter chair at IEEE NSUT student chapter.

# What am I upto these days?
I'm currently a research intern at [Dr. Arnab Barik's Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/molecules-cells-and-circuits/home) analyzing behavior in mice when put on a Hot/Cold Plate. Here's a glimpse of what we've done:

I'm currently working on classifying animal behavior and with any luck hoping to find anomalies in them.
Other than that, I'm also gaining interest in Neuroengineering, especially engineering for prosthesis. I'm currently in my final year at Netaji Subhas University of Technology(erstwhile Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology) and planning to do MSc or PhD in Deep Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Neuroengineering or related field(s).
If you wish to know more about the projects, I will be posting blogs on them. Wish me luck!  
I'm always open to discussions and sharing resources to know more about Deep Learning and work on some interesting projects or maybe exchange ideas!
Anyway, thank you for stopping by.
