# Hey!
I'm often asked what are some good resources to study deep learning or machine learning. To answer that here's a list of resources that one can refer to. Also I happen to misplace(sometimes) some of the resources myself :P
I plan to make this an open source collection of all courses related to deep learning. It would be great if you would like to contribute to expand this list

## For Starters
1. [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)   
	I started with this and so did million other people, so yea...... 
	There's a YouTube playlist but I would suggest auditing the course on coursera or asking for coursera aid.  
	[<img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" src = "https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/video-youtube-icon-27.png">](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN)
2. [Fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)  
	Their course gives head start to people working in industry wanting to use deep learning. Their tutorials are based on the library [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/). The community is super awesome and supportive. Checkout discussions at their [forum](https://forums.fast.ai/) and [discord](https://discord.gg/gJCzcJAg).  
	[<img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" src = "https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/video-youtube-icon-27.png">](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtRL3FMB3GoWHRI8ieU6FhfM)
3. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)  
	Fastai's codebase is based on PyTorch. It's one of the highly used frameworks and has awesome tutorials online with an active [community](https://discuss.pytorch.org/).
	Most of your questions would already be answered there. If you are exploring that means you wish to create models more intuitively and maybe create custom pipelines.  
	[<img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" src = "https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/video-youtube-icon-27.png">](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_lsbAsL_o2CTlGHgMxNrKhzP97BaG9ZN)
4. [NYU - Deep Learning course](https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP21/)  
	The one of the most popular courses freely available online. I love the visualizations in the blogs and [Alfredo](https://atcold.github.io/)'s practical tutorials. Another plus point of the tutorial is it's practical. One gets to learn theory along with the syntax and design of the model.  
	[<img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" src = "https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/video-youtube-icon-27.png">](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLHTzKZzVU9eaEyErdV26ikyolxOsz6mq)
5. [Intro to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)  
	This is a diverse course, covering a lot of applications of deep learning with concepts.  
	[<img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" src = "https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/video-youtube-icon-27.png">](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI)

2. [Geometric Deep Learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/lectures/)  
	This course is based on [Michael Bronstein](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.bronstein) et al's [Proto Book]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478)) which discusses about exploiting lower-dimensional features to study and improve neural networks.  
	[<img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" src = "https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/video-youtube-icon-27.png">](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn2-dEmQeTfQ8YVuHBOvAhUlnIPYxkeu3)
	
3. [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/methoden-des-maschinellen-lernens/lehre/probabilistic-machine-learning/)  
	This course provides an introductionÂ to core concepts of machine learning from the probabilistic perspective.

	<h4>Reinforcement Learning</h4>  
	</a>
	1. [Reinforcement Learning Course | Deepmind & UCL](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/reinforcement-learning-series-2021)  
		From the link:   
		Comprising 13 lectures, the series covers the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and planning in sequential decision problems, before progressing to more advanced topics and modern deep RL algorithms. It gives students a detailed understanding of various topics, including Markov Decision Processes, sample-based learning algorithms (e.g. (double) Q-learning, SARSA), deep reinforcement learning, and more. It also explores more advanced topics like off-policy learning, multi-step updates and eligibility traces, as well as conceptual and practical considerations in implementing deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as rainbow DQN.
