# Hey!
I'm just a guy who wants to create a legacy. I like to code and engineer, I love mathematics.
I've particularly gained interest in the study of brain - Neuroscience and its engineering - Neuroengineering.
I'm often asked what are some good resources to study deep learning or machine learning. As a result I'm creating this post just for links and respective short descriptions.


## For Starters
1. [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
	I started with this and so did million other people, so yea......
1. [Fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)
	Their course gives head start to people working in industry wanting to use deep learning. Their tutorials are based on the library [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/). The community is super awesome and supportive. Checkout discussions at their [forum](https://forums.fast.ai/) and [discord](https://discord.gg/gJCzcJAg)

2. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
	Fastai's codebase is based on PyTorch. It's one of the highly used frameworks and has awesome tutorials online with an active[community](https://discuss.pytorch.org/).
	Most of your questions would already be answered there. If you are exploring that means you wish to create models more intuitively and maybe create custom pipelines.
